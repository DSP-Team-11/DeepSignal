## What Can You Do With DeepSignal?

### üè• Medical Signals Analysis

**For ECG (Heart Signals):**
- Upload your ECG data and instantly see if it shows any of 4 common heart conditions
- View your heart signals in different ways:
  - **Standard View**: Scroll through heartbeats, control speed, zoom in/out
  - **XOR View**: Spot differences between heartbeats easily
  - **Polar View**: See heart rhythms in a circular display
  - **Recurrence View**: Understand patterns between different heart channels

**For EEG (Brain Signals):**
- Detect 4 types of brain activity patterns
- Same easy-to-use viewers as ECG
- Perfect for researchers and students

### üîä Sound Analysis

**Doppler Effect Simulator:**
- Create the sound of a car passing by (you know that "weee-ooow" sound!)
- Adjust the car speed and horn frequency
- See the sound visualized as a spectrogram
- Download your created sounds
- Upload real car sounds to detect their speed and frequency automatically

**Drone Detection:**
- Upload any sound file
- Our AI will tell you if it contains drone sounds or not
- Great for security or hobbyist use
