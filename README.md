</p>

- Upload your ECG data and instantly see if it shows any of 4 common heart conditions
- View your heart signals in different ways:

**Standard View**: Scroll through heartbeats, control speed, zoom in/out

</p>

- Adjust the car speed and horn frequency
- See the sound visualized as a spectrogram

<p align="center">
  <img src="1_site_pics/Screenshot 2025-10-09 203053.png" alt="DeepSignal Preview" >
</p>

- Download your created sounds
- Upload real car sounds to detect their speed and frequency automatically
